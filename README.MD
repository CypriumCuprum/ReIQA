# Re-IQA: Unsupervised Learning for Image Quality Assessment in the Wild

Official PyTorch implementation of Re-IQA, a No-Reference Image Quality Assessment algorithm proposed in [IEEE/CVF CVPR 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00451). Re-IQA achieves SoTA performance across popular NR-IQA databases.
